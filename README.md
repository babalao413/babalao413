### Hi there! 👋

I'm Phill Chigiya, but you can call me **Baba Lao 413** 🌍

In my spare time, I'm busy treating patients and working as a global health practitioner 🏥💼

🌱 Currently, I'm diving into the world of coding with R, and I'm on my way to becoming a coding pro! 💻🚀

Here's a glimpse of my GitHub profile:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing my R programming skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with mastering data visualization in R.
- 💬 Ask me about global health, patient care, or anything R-related!
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-t-chigiya-2a784aa7/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YourTwitterHandle).

😄 Fun fact: I'm passionate about bridging the gap between healthcare and technology, one line of code at a time!

Feel free to connect with me on social media, and let's make the world a healthier place together! 🌏
